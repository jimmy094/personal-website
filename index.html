            Hello! My name is Jimmy. I am currently a student at the Flatiron school. I am currenlty in the SWE bootcamp
            learning about fullstack web development. I am excited to go on this journey coming from a non tech background.
            I will be diving right into this new field with the goal of changing careers from banking, (where I have
            been working for the last 6 years to Web development. My ultimate goal would be to combine my banking experience
            with the new skills I will be learning over the next few months to work in fintech.

        <p id="why">
            I chose to learn how to code because I have always been very interested
            in it. I have a desire to build things but I never felt like I had a skill to let me 
            channel that desire. I have never really took the opportunity to learn in the past. I was
            under a false assumption that you had to be doing it since you were a kid, or 
            that you had to be a <a href="file:///Users/jimmyalvarez/personal-website/gif%20page.html">genius</a>. After learning that it was doable and that I 
            can switch careers.

        <p id="goals">
            My goals are to become well versed in web development. I plan to take
            the skills I learn at The Flatiron school and work in fintech. I feel that 
            i have learned alot working in banks for the last 6 years and also studying economics in college
            that combining web dev skills with my banking knowledge, I can be a valuable
            asset to a financial institution.
